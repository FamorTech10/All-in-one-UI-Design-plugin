<h1 align="center">About</h1>

All in one UI Design Plugin (i don't know a name yet) is a plugin that started as a plugin for personal use, some of its tools are inspired from really cool plugins such as [AutoScaleLite](https://www.roblox.com/library/1496745047/AutoScale-Lite) and [uiDesign Lite](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/uidesign-plugins/401173), the reason behind the creation of this plugin is to have an All in one plugin, removing the need to change from different plugins or windows.

## features


Gui object converter
This incredible usefull tool converts any guiobject into other type of gui object for example you can convert a textlabel to a button and keep all of its properties!. This features was inspired by uiDesignPro


Align
The align function came from Adobe Illustrator. It aligns a gui object in the screen



Basic object Transformation
At least for me its always anoying having to scroll all the way down or up for a property, and its even worse having to change window for that, that problem vanished by adding basic transformations to the plugin. I will add more properties iin the next update.


unit convertion
Basic unit convertion to convert scale to offset and viceversa (inspired by AutoScaleLite)


And a few extra functions
The Quick Actions holds functions that i tend to use a lot.
